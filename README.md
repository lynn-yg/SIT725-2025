# SIT725 - Week Project: Express Calculator API

This project is a simple **Node.js** and **Express** web service that performs basic calculator operations â€” Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division â€” using RESTful endpoints.

It was developed as part of SIT725 coursework to demonstrate backend skills using Express, HTTP methods, and basic API testing in the browser.

## ðŸ§ª API Endpoints

You can test the endpoints by running the server and accessing these URLs in your browser:

| Operation     | Endpoint Example |
|---------------|------------------|
| Addition      | `/add?num1=10&num2=5` â†’ `{ "result": 15 }` |
| Subtraction   | `/subtract?num1=10&num2=5` â†’ `{ "result": 5 }` |
| Multiplication| `/multiply?num1=10&num2=5` â†’ `{ "result": 50 }` |
| Division      | `/divide?num1=10&num2=5` â†’ `{ "result": 2 }` |
